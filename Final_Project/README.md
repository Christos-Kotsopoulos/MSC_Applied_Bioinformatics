This a program for the course "UNIX & Programming Basics"

This a program used to find simple bacterial ORF's in DNA or RNA sequences. It treats the first AUG codon found from either direction as the start codon and the other AUG's as M residues. It also
provides the user with their final ORF, a list where their sequnce's codons are stored and finally the possible protein sequence from the translation of provided sequence. Futhermore it provides 
the choice for the user to check if the reverse complement of the sequnce her used as input contains an ORF. Finally the program stores the finding in a .txt file in the current directory of the user
To use this program you will need the re library and python3 downloaded  in order to exit you can type -exit- at any time
